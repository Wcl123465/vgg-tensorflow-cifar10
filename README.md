# vgg-tensorflow-cifar10
cifar10 dataset in vgg architecture by tensorflow
## Hardware config info.
tensorflow-gpu: 1.4  
python: 3.5  
gpu: tesla P4  
system: windows7(main) or ubuntu16.04  
IDE: pycharm  
## Introduction
This project includes four sessions:  
data processing: cifar10_vgg_processing.py  
network architecture: vgg.py  
model train, validation and test: cifar10_vgg_train  
hyper parameters: hyper_parameters.py  
For the data processing section, cifar10 dataset, which is converted to filepath form, it looks like TF-record form.  
  For the vgg_train file, which includes trian model, validation model and test model.
